## Project Overview
---
The project aims to create a comprehensive knowledge repository that integrates encyclopedia, personal knowledge management, and peer-to-peer functionalities.
Inspired by existing projects like MIT Open-Course-Ware and Wikipedia, 
the repository will be open-source, decentralized, and focused on fostering curiosity-driven learning.
It will utilize semantic graph technology, version control similar to Git, and incorporate fact-checking mechanisms to combat misinformation.


## Vision and Goals
---
The vision is to democratize access to knowledge and promote critical thinking by providing a platform for collaborative learning. 
The goals include:
Establishing a decentralized network for knowledge sharing.
Implementing fact-checking mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of information.
Integrating version control and semantic graph technology for content management and organization.
Empowering users to contribute to and curate the repository in a peer-to-peer manner.

## Inspirations
---
The project draws inspiration from the spirit of openness and collaboration embodied by existing projects. 
It seeks to build upon their principles while incorporating novel features to address current challenges in knowledge sharing and dissemination.


## Findings
### Background: 
---
In today's hyper-specialized world, there is a growing need for interdisciplinary knowledge and a platform that fosters curiosity-driven learning. 
Traditional education systems often prioritize specialization and certification over holistic understanding, leading to a lack of emphasis on the interconnectedness of various fields.


## Methodology: 
---
The project will adopt a bottom-up approach, leveraging existing open-source technologies and building upon them to create a unified knowledge repository. It will prioritize user-centric design, ensuring that the platform is intuitive and accessible to a diverse audience. Collaboration with experts in different domains will be crucial for ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the content.


## Time-frame
---
The project will be developed iteratively, with regular updates and improvements based on user feedback. A tentative timeline for the initial development phase is approximately 2-3 years, with ongoing maintenance and enhancements thereafter.


## Assets Required
---
### Human resources: 
Developers, designers, content creators, and subject matter experts.

### Technological resources: 
Servers, storage, and bandwidth for hosting the repository.

### Financial resources: 
Funding for development, maintenance, and community outreach efforts.


## Support
---
### Guidance: 
Collaboration with established organizations and experts in relevant fields will provide valuable guidance throughout the project.

### Contribution: 
Community involvement and contributions will be encouraged through open-source collaboration platforms, forums, and hackathons.


## Definitions
---
### Decentralized Web:
A web infrastructure where content is distributed across multiple servers and nodes rather than being hosted on a centralized server.

### Semantic Graph:  
A graph-based data model where nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships between them, enriched with semantic metadata.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P):  
A network architecture where participants share resources directly without the need for central coordination.

### Version Control:  
The management of changes to documents, programs, and other information over time, enabling multiple contributors to collaborate efficiently.
